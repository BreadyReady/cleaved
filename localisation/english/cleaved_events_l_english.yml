cleaving_news.0.desc.a:0 "A great change has stricken Mewni! 1: Locations of places have shifted completely, much of the Kingdom is diconnected! 2: Almost all of magic has stopped working, the Magic High Commision just disintegrated to dust! and 3: A large part of the Kingdom seems to have 'merged' with another, unknown, civilization. And Butterfly Castle itself has been merged with them!\n\nNot all is bad, though. Mina Loveberry's magic has also ceased, stopping the coup what was occuring just hours before. The magic needed for magic creatures and Kingdoms to exist and keep in contact still works. Finally, the civilization merged with us is comprised of people like us. That is to say, not Monsters"
