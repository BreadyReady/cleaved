 visnov_variable_text_speech_7:0 "§gAbove, while the Mewnman sky still shimmers with multi-colored gradients, the three moons of Mewni are nowhere to be found. Eclipsa, tired from battle, sits down on a scorched stone.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_8:0 "§gThe gallop of warnicorn hooves reaches Eclipsa's ears. A Mewman knight makes haste towards Eclipsa, blue armor and regalia on helmet. He reaches Eclipsa and dismounts, kneels, and speaks...§!"

 visnov_variable_text_speech_9:0 "Queen Eclipsa! Thank goodness you're alive! I come with the message that Mina Loveberry's been defeated. Please, hop on. You'll get more details at Quasar castle."
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_10:0 "§gThey both got on, the knight taking the reins. Riding off, they pass gigantic puddles on their way. Some of them hold devastated buildings and towns, and even some bodies...§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_11:0 "§gQuasar Castle is built in the same architechture style as Butterfly Castle. It towers over the surrounding chaotic village and it's spires touch the sky. Eclipsa dismounts within it's hectic walls and enters the interior.§!"

 visnov_variable_text_speech_18:0 "§gThey rush to each other, meeting in the middle and embracing in a group hug. The strategizing council watches on, a bit annoyed at the interruption but willing to let them show their affections.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_19:0 "Star, Marco, I was so worried about your safety! Are you two hurt at all? Riding through the country side from the Monster Temple was so heartbreaking..."
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_20:0 "We're both fine. Oh gosh Eclipsa, do ya know what's going on out there? What you saw wasn't even the worst of it! Butterfly Castle, our home, that's where alot of damage is. The west..."
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_21:0 "The west has fallen..."
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_22:0 "§gStar shakes a bit, and a tear forms in her eye. Marco pats her on the back, comforting her. Whatever they've all been talking about at the table, it's clearly shaken Star to her core.§!"

 visnov_variable_text_speech_29:0 "§gOnce they're gone, a sigh of dissapointment fills the room. The table of strategists lose what they hoped would be their leader in this vital time. One of the knight captains says what all of them are thinking."

 visnov_variable_text_speech_30:0 "This is why we've had those civil wars..."

 visnov_variable_text_speech_33:0 "§gAs they reach the doorway, Eclipsa thinks she sees a glimpse of resolve in Star's eyes, but she dissapears behind the door before Eclipsa can clearly see anything definitive.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_34:0 "§gEclipsa turns to the table and sees that the strategists all seem relieved. She knows that she has a reputation of being too empathetic, but she knows she can be strong for Mewni as well.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_35:0 "Well then? Go on, let's get down to business."
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_36:0 "§gIn a quiet saloon in wild Nevada, away from the laws and authorities of Humans, Monsters, or the Wrathmeliors, a group of people were calmly sipping on... age-appropriate beverages.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_37:0 "§gA drifter from aways-away bursts in, spurs jingling against the creaking floor as he shakes off desert dust from his coat. He takes a seat right next to another patron, whose wide-brimmed hat hid all but a scowling mouth§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_38:0 "§gThe entire saloon's patronage eyes up the duo. Gamblers in the corner stop their game, the bartender pauses wiping a glass, and what small coversation was happening suddenly quiets down. All eyes were on them.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speaker_11:0 "Lonesome Nevada Drifter"
 visnov_variable_text_speech_39:0 "§g*Gruff sigh as he sets his hat on the bar*§! I guess you already know, I ain't exactly here for a friendly drink."
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_40:0 "§gThe mysterious figure smirked, then set down their own hat as well. Two long ribbon like bands of hair flowed down from her spaceball hair, and her green eyes casually sized up the drifter.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speech_41:0 "§gThe drifter is taken aback by her appearance. Her hair is messy, she's scarred and beat up. And still, despite being incredibly worse off than the bounty pictures, there is a piercing determination in her eyes.§!"
 
 visnov_variable_text_speaker_12:0 "§0Mina Loveberry§!"
 visnov_variable_text_speech_42:0 "You and many others, human. Tell me do you know what these mean?"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_43:0 "§gShe slowly unsheathes a sword and sets it on the bar. She runs her fingers against the edge of the blade, highlighting 20 notches made at the base of the metal. She seems to enjoy drawing her own blood.§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_44:0 "20 Marks, 20 bounty hunters. All of them tasted this very blade. What makes you think you're special?"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_45:0 "§gWithout words, the drifter also pulls out his weapon. A silver gleaming revolver. He sets it down on the bar and keeps his hand on it. There are 21 notches on the barrel.§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_46:0 "§gMina smirks, then whistles. Every customer of the bar rises to their feet and reveals their own weapons, from daggers and swords to rifles. Every patron of the bar was part of Mina's gang, the drifter was surrounded.§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_47:0 "This oughta be fun."
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_48:0 "Yeah. Oughta."
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_49:0 "§gThe Drifter raises his gun. Mina raises her sword. The gang descends upon them. And at the end of it all...§!"

  visnov_variable_dec2_text_scripted_loc_4:0 "The Drifter Kills Mina!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_50:0 "§gThe Drifter manages to get a few shots off and harm Mina: Her eye is shot at an angle, and the gruesome sight of the wound is hard even for Mina's hardened gang to stomach. But ultimatley, the Drifter is struck down.§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_51:0 "§gWith the entire gang reeling at Mina's sight, she calmly sits back down at the bar. With one hand, she sips her drink. With the other hand, she starts making another notch on her bloodied blade...§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_52:0 "§gThe Drifter strikes like lightning and moves like a cat. He manages to dodge and fire enough times to mercilessly execute Mina's gang. The bar is coated with red, and the air is thick with a mettalic and gunpowdery haze.§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_53:0 "§gWith a groan of pain, he takes a seat on the bar. He wasn't able to dodge every strike, and he's bleeding hard. He ganders over to where Mina was sitting, and spots her drink. He grabs it and weakly takes a sip.§!"
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_54:0 "Mm. You had good taste, Ms. Loveberry. Real good taste..."
  
  visnov_variable_text_speech_55:0 "§gThe Lonesonesome Drifter slumps over the bar and dies. With everybody dead, and the bar so isolated from civilization, the tale of the Drifter's and Loveberry's lasts stands will be lost to the mojave sun."
