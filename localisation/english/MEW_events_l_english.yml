MEW_event.0.t:0 "To the Castle"
MEW_event.0.desc:0 "Eclipsa Butterfly emerged from the ruins of the Monster Temple, tiptoeing on the rubble. Mere hours before, the walls were shaking under Mina's seige. The scars of Soalrian blades were still smouldering as she walked out on the high pile of rubble gracefully to meet a knight on warnicornback below.\n\n"Your highness! Thank goodness you're ok! I've been sent from Butterfly Castle to escort you back. Something very strange has happened, we need you at the throne! Globgor's waiting for you there as well."\n\nEclipsa simply nodded, and hopped on behind the knight. With a "Hiya!" they were off at full gallop.\n\nAt first, there was a distinct silence. But as they approached closer and closer to their destination, the chaos grew. Mass bands fleeing west, buildings collapsed for seemingly no reason, and the like. As they finally reached the Castle, Eclipsa got off and took in the sight. Flames, screams, rubble. Butterfly Castle itself was in chaos.\n\nShe put her fists on her hips, and in her royal way of speaking, said..."
MEW_event.0.a:0 ""Well. That's certainly less than ideal.""

MEW_event.1.t:0 "Most Important Thing"
MEW_event.1.desc:0 "Eclipsa was sat at the end of a great table, hastily drawn maps covering it. She was flanked by knights, and the lead one was moving little improvised figurines on the maps, one of them was a corn kernel.\n\n"As you can see we have been restoring order to the surrounding area. But, we've been finding cities that weren't there before. They aren't small, either. Millions of people. Apparently, we've been trespassing on the territory of the United States of America. We've decided to halt operations until-"\n\nSLAM\n\n"Eclipsa!" Star Butterfly stood in the doorway, she had kicked open the door.\n\n"Star!" Eclipsa immediatly stood up and met her as she ran in. They hugged in the middle.\n\n"I thought you were dead, Star!" Eclipsa looked behind her, and saw Marco Diaz. "You too!"\n\n"Ah, come on. It'll take alot more than that to take down Star Butterfly!"\n\nEclipsa laughed. "Well how about this, warrior princess. Let's go visit the royal candy stash, it's been a while and I need the break."\n\nAs they left, the lead knight leant on the table and sighed."

MEW_event.3.desc:0 "Moon Butterfly is back at it again.\n\nBarely a few months have passed since the Cleaving, and already earth’s culture has begun impacting Mewni. This is most evident in the new “Parties” popping up all over the Kingdom. While many parties have begun to pop up, some of which are exactly the same except for region, they can all be grouped into two categories: The Progressives, and the Traditionalists. Already, once-peaceful communities have been torn apart by this ideological rift as heated debates devolve to insults and infighting. Eclipsa Butterfly, on account of her pro-monster sympathies, is an ardent supporter of the progressives.\n\nMoon Butterfly, the Queen before Eclipsa, leads the Traditionalist New Butterfly Party. She is famous as a symbol of the Kingdom before Eclipsa's ascension, before the monster rights movement and when the Kingdom was still stable. And although there is the possibility that she supported the Loveberrian Coup, her supporters mosty opt to dismiss these as rumors (if only believe in something better than Eclipsa’s Mewni.)\n\nHeck, some are even seeing it as a good thing."

As the tale goes, the first Mewmans almost froze to death in the ruthless untamed Mewman winds. It was only by gathering around a stump and clinging on were they able to survive the night and build the Kingdom we all now hold so dear.\n\nThis Stump day is especially uniting. In the Cleaved Zone, Mewmans and Humans alike are sharing holiday cheer as human Christmas just so happens to coincide with Stump day. They even have many of the same traditions: While the Stump Day Cob is replaced with the Christmas Ham, and the Stump has been replaced with a baby evergreen, the spirit of the Stump is still there."

I'm getting the heck outta dodge!"§!\n\nThis civil war has been hard, but Mewman patriotism has been pulling us through to get things done. However, humans lack this patriotism and the many who live in our lands have fled due to the civil war. The most visible of these fleeing humans is Marco Diaz: the grossly incompetent head advisor, only securing his job due to his relationship with Star Butterfly. Caught in the act of attempting to flee, Diaz confessed that he intended to steal gold from the treasury to transport his family to Canada, seeking refuge.\n\nThe most logical option here is to allow him to flee. He is an incompetent nepotistic hire in a position of great power. However, Star Butterfly has insisted on his stay, stating that he has 'unseen potential.'"

She thanked Eclipsa for the break, and went back into the fray to help in a more reasonable manner.\n\nOf course, not before givng Marco a parting kiss on the cheek.
